d:T42e,Welcome to the automation game! Here's your starter pack:

**Essential Recipe #1: Status-Driven Notifications**
Recipe: 'When status changes to something, notify someone'
Use case: When content moves to 'Ready for Review,' notify your editor automatically.

**Essential Recipe #2: Deadline Reminders**
Recipe: 'When date arrives, notify someone'
Use case: 2-day warning before publish dates.

**Essential Recipe #3: Auto-Assignment**
Recipe: 'When item created, assign someone' or 'When status changes to something, assign someone'
Use case: Blog posts tagged 'SEO' auto-assign to your SEO specialist.

**Recipe vs Custom:**
Recipes = Pre-built, reliable, easy to set up. Start here.
Custom = Build from scratch using triggers and actions. Use when recipes don't cover your specific need.

**Pro tip:** Use the 'Dependencies' automation for your editorial calendar. When the 'Draft' phase completes, it can automatically set the 'Review' phase to start 2 days later.

Start with 3-4 automations, test them thoroughly, then add more. Too many automations at once = chaos.e:T43e,After 2 years of trial and error, here's my recommended setup:

**Start with these 4 boards:**

1. **Content Calendar** (use the Editorial Calendar template)
   - Modify it to include: Content Type, Target Keyword, Funnel Stage, Distribution Channels
   - Connect this to your Social Media board

2. **Campaign Tracker** (Campaign Planning template)
   - One item per campaign with subitems for tactics
   - Budget tracking column is essential

3. **Creative Requests** (Creative Requests template)
   - Form view for other departments to submit requests
   - Priority and Due Date columns with automations

4. **Social Media Content** (Social Media Calendar template)
   - Link items to Content Calendar for repurposing tracking

**Skip these templates:**
• The 'Marketing Strategy' template — too vague, you'll never use it
• Anything with 20+ columns — analysis paralysis

**Structure tip:** Keep boards separate but connected. Use the 'Connect Boards' column to link a blog post to its social promotion tasks and campaign.

Start simple. You can always add complexity later.f:T43c,Native time tracking has limitations, but here's how to maximize it:

**Subtask tracking:** Unfortunately, you can't track time on subitems separately from parent items. Workaround: Make subitems their own items in a separate 'Tasks' board and connect them to the main project. More setup, but gives you granular tracking.

**Client reporting:**
1. Add a 'Client' dropdown column to your board
2. Use the Time Tracking widget in dashboards
3. Filter by client and date range
4. Export view as PDF for client-friendly reports

**Billable amounts:** Add a Formula column: {Time Tracking#Hours} * {Hourly Rate}

**Export:** Yes! Go to your board → ... menu → Export → Export to Excel. Time tracking data exports with hours broken down.

**Better habits:**
• Use the mobile app timer — easier to start/stop
• Set up automations: 'When status changes to In Progress, start time tracking'
• Add a 'Billable?' checkbox column to separate billable vs internal time

For serious billing, Toggl integration is worth it. But for basic tracking, native works fine with these tweaks.10:T43d,Used both for product teams. Here's the honest breakdown:

**ClickUp pros:**
• All-in-one (docs, whiteboards, chat) — fewer tools to manage
• More affordable at scale
• Incredible customization

**ClickUp cons:**
• Feature bloat — your team will spend weeks configuring instead of working
• Steep learning curve — non-technical folks struggle
• Mobile app is buggy
• Performance issues with large workspaces

**monday.com pros:**
• Beautiful, intuitive UI — adoption is fast
• Stable and fast at scale
• Better mobile experience
• Superior automation builder

**monday.com cons:**
• Docs are basic (we use Notion alongside)
• Whiteboards limited (we use FigJam)
• More expensive

**For product teams specifically:**
ClickUp has native sprint features. monday.com requires more setup but ends up cleaner.

My recommendation: If your team is technical and patient, ClickUp. If you want something that just works out of the box, monday.com.

We chose monday.com and haven't regretted it. We use integrations for docs/whiteboards rather than all-in-one.11:T414,Former MS Project user here. monday.com's Gantt is simpler, but here's how to make it work:

**Setting up dependencies:**
1. Add a 'Dependency' column
2. In Gantt view, drag the dependency lines between tasks
3. Use the automation: 'When this date changes, shift dependent dates'

**Limitations you'll hit:**
• No true critical path calculation
• No resource leveling
• Limited baseline tracking (you can snapshot dates manually)

**Workarounds:**
For critical path, use color coding. Set a status for 'Critical Path' items and filter by that color in Gantt view.

For resource allocation, add a 'Assigned To' column and use the Workload view (Pro plan). It shows who's overloaded across all projects.

**My honest take:** For construction with 50+ tasks and complex dependencies, monday.com Gantt will frustrate you. Consider:
• Smartsheet (better Gantt, integrates with monday.com)
• Keep high-level milestones in monday.com, detailed schedules in MS Project

monday.com excels at team collaboration, not complex project scheduling.12:T42a,I manage 30 field techs using monday.com mobile daily. Here's the real story:

**What works great:**
• Status updates — one tap, done
• Photo uploads — camera integration is smooth
• Push notifications — instant and reliable
• Offline mode — updates sync when connection returns
• Time tracking — start/stop timer is easy

**What's frustrating:**
• Complex boards are hard to navigate on mobile
• Can't edit formulas or automations
• Dashboards don't render well (use board views instead)
• Search is limited

**For field work specifically:**
• Create mobile-friendly board views with only essential columns
• Use the 'Cards' view on mobile — much better than table
• Set up QR codes at job sites that link directly to monday.com items
• Train techs to use voice-to-text for updates

**Verdict:** For status updates, photos, and time tracking, it's excellent. For complex project management, you'll need desktop.

My techs complete 90% of their monday.com work on mobile. The 10% that requires desktop is planning and reporting.13:T470,Made the switch from Typeform 6 months ago. Here's what you need to know:

**What monday.com Forms CAN do:**
• All your field types (text, dropdown, date, long text, file upload)
• Custom branding (logo, colors, cover image)
• Email notifications on submission (via automation)
• Auto-assignment based on dropdown selection
• Pre-fill fields via URL parameters

**What it CAN'T do (vs Typeform):**
• Conditional logic (show/hide questions) — this is the big one
• Calculated fields
• Payment collection
• Advanced design customization
• Logic jumps

**The workaround for conditional logic:**
Create separate forms for different project types, then use a 'router' form that asks 'What type of project?' and redirects to the appropriate form.

**Auto-assignment setup:**
Automation: 'When item created and Project Type is Website, assign to Sarah'

**My verdict:** If you need simple intake without complex logic, monday.com Forms is perfect and saves you money. If you rely heavily on conditional questions, stick with Typeform or JotForm.

We saved $35/month and gained automatic project creation. Worth it for us.14:T440,Built 50+ executive dashboards. Here's what actually gets used:

**Must-have widgets:**

1. **Battery Widget** (Project Health)
   - Shows on track/at risk/blocked at a glance
   - Executives love the traffic light system

2. **Numbers Widget** (KPI Summary)
   - Total active projects, completion %, budget remaining
   - Big numbers they can screenshot for presentations

3. **Chart Widget** (Trends)
   - Line chart of completed tasks over time
   - Shows velocity trends

4. **Workload Widget** (Resource Management)
   - Who's overloaded, who has capacity
   - Essential for resource planning discussions

**Skip these:**
• Calendar widget (too detailed for execs)
• File gallery (irrelevant)
• Most custom chart widgets (overcomplicate)

**Multi-board dashboards:**
Yes! When adding a widget, select 'Choose boards' and pick multiple. You can aggregate data across departments.

**Pro tip:** Create two versions:
• High-level dashboard for executives (5 widgets max)
• Detailed dashboard for managers (10+ widgets)

Executives want the story, not the data. Keep it simple.15:T42e,I've helped 20+ teams navigate this exact decision. Option A (hybrid) wins almost every time.

**Why not all-in on monday.com:**
monday.com Docs exist but they're nowhere near Notion's quality. You'd lose your wiki, meeting notes, and knowledge base experience.

**Why not stay all-in Notion:**
Notion's project management is a glorified spreadsheet. No real automations, no proper resource management, no client portals.

**The winning hybrid setup:**
• Notion: Company wiki, meeting notes, documentation, specs, onboarding
• monday.com: Project tracking, client work, automations, dashboards, time tracking

**How to connect them:**
1. Use the monday.com Notion integration — embed Notion pages in monday.com items
2. Link monday.com board URLs in Notion project pages
3. Use Zapier/Make for cross-platform automations

**The key rule:** Each piece of information lives in ONE place. Don't duplicate.

For your GitHub integration need specifically, monday.com is far superior. The native GitHub integration syncs PRs, commits, and issues directly to board items.16:T44f,Migrated our 8-person team from Trello 6 months ago. Here's the honest experience:

**Migration process:**
1. monday.com has a built-in Trello importer — one-click migration per board
2. Cards become items, lists become groups, labels become status columns
3. Comments and attachments migrate too
4. Takes about 5 minutes per board

**The adjustment period:**
First week was rough. monday.com looks different and has more options. Some team members missed Trello's simplicity.

By week 3, everyone preferred monday.com. The 'aha moment' was automations — things that required Trello power-ups (paid) work natively in monday.com.

**For kanban lovers:**
monday.com's Kanban view is excellent. Actually better than Trello because you can customize card fields, add swimlanes, and filter without power-ups.

**Is it overkill?**
Only if you don't use the extra features. Start with just the kanban view and add features gradually. Don't try to set up everything on day one.

For a design team specifically: the file column, creative review workflows, and integration with Figma make it worth the switch.17:T4bf,Moved my 18-person engineering team from Jira to monday.com. It's been 10 months.

**What works:**
• Sprint planning — create sprint groups, add story point columns, track velocity with dashboard widgets
• Bug tracking — custom status flows per board, priority columns, automated assignment
• Stakeholder visibility — product, design, and execs actually use it now. That alone was worth the switch.
• GitHub integration — PRs and commits link to items automatically

**What we miss from Jira:**
• JQL (Jira Query Language) — nothing in monday.com matches the power of complex JQL queries
• Native sprint reports (burndown charts etc.) — we build these in dashboards but they're not as polished
• Confluence integration depth

**The real impact:**
Before: Jira was the 'developer tool' nobody else touched. Now the entire company is on one platform.

Cross-team visibility went from zero to complete. Product can see engineering status without asking. Designers link mockups directly to sprint items.

**My advice:** If your team is 50+ devs doing SAFe/complex agile, stay on Jira. If you're 15-30 and value cross-team collaboration over developer-specific features, monday.com is the move.18:T4d1,Been building on the monday.com API for 3 years. Here's the crash course:

**Authentication:**
Go to Admin > API. Generate a personal token or use OAuth for apps. Include it as: Authorization: your_token_here

**Basic query structure:**
It's GraphQL, so you request exactly what you need. Start with the API playground (monday.com/developers) — it has autocomplete and documentation.

**Complexity budget tips:**
• You get 10,000,000 complexity points per minute
• Querying all items on a large board eats budget fast
• Use pagination: items_page(limit: 25) instead of fetching everything
• Cache responses where possible
• Use column_values(ids: ["status", "date"]) instead of fetching all columns

**Column values gotcha:**
The column_values.value field is a JSON string. You need to parse it. Each column type has a different JSON structure. The documentation for each column type is your best friend.

**Webhooks:**
Use the create_webhook mutation. You'll need a publicly accessible endpoint. monday.com sends POST requests when items change. Verify with the challenge token on first setup.

**Rate limiting strategy:** Batch your mutations using the complexity_query to check remaining budget before bulk operations.19:T4ed,Great question. Here's my decision framework after building both:

**Use built-in automations + Zapier/Make when:**
• The workflow is simple (trigger → action)
• You need it working in hours, not days
• Non-developers need to modify it
• The integration already exists in the marketplace
• Volume is low (< 1000 triggers/month)

**Use custom webhooks when:**
• You need complex logic (conditions, loops, data transformation)
• High volume (1000+ triggers/month) — Zapier gets expensive
• You need guaranteed delivery and retry logic
• Data needs to flow to internal systems behind firewalls
• You want full control over error handling

**For your specific cases:**
• Deal → Project: Webhook. You probably need data transformation.
• Urgent → PagerDuty: Built-in automation with PagerDuty integration (it exists!)
• Data sync: Webhook + database. Too complex for Zapier.
• PDF generation: Webhook. Need custom logic for PDF creation.

**Reliability notes:**
• monday.com webhooks are reliable but have no built-in retry
• Zapier has retry logic but adds latency (30-60 second delay)
• Custom = you control everything but own the infrastructure

My rule: Start with automations. Move to webhooks when you hit limitations.1a:T4df,I manage guest access for a 200-person org with 50+ external guests. Here's the complete guide:

**Guest user basics:**
• Guests DON'T count toward seat limits (huge cost saver)
• You can invite unlimited viewers on Pro/Enterprise plans
• Guests can be 'viewers' or 'members' of specific boards
• They only see boards they're explicitly invited to

**Hiding columns from guests:**
• Use column permissions (Enterprise feature) to restrict visibility
• On lower plans, create a separate 'Client View' board that mirrors only the columns you want shared
• Use the 'Shareable Board' type — designed for external sharing

**Dashboard access:**
• Guests CAN access dashboards if given permission
• Create client-specific dashboards showing only their boards
• The 'View Only' permission prevents any modifications

**Best structure for agencies:**
1. Internal board: Full project details, costs, team notes
2. Client board: Milestones, status, files (Connected/Mirrored from internal)
3. Automate: When internal status changes, mirror to client board

**Security tips:**
• Enable 2FA for all accounts
• Review guest access quarterly
• Use the Activity Log to monitor guest actions
• Never put pricing data on shared boards1b:T4cf,Critical topic that most monday.com admins overlook. Here's the full picture:

**monday.com's built-in protections:**
• Deleted items go to a 30-day Recycle Bin (then permanently deleted)
• Deleted boards can be recovered within 30 days
• Activity logs are retained for 6 months (Pro) or unlimited (Enterprise)
• monday.com has their own server backups (99.9% SLA)

**Export options:**
• Board export: Excel/CSV (includes column data, excludes files)
• Account-level export: Admin > Export (all boards, takes time for large accounts)
• API export: Most comprehensive — query everything including files, updates, activity logs

**Third-party backup solutions:**
• Rewind.io — automated daily backups, one-click restore
• CData — sync to your own database for full control
• Custom: Use the API + cloud storage (S3/GCS) for DIY backups

**My recommended strategy:**
1. Weekly automated export via API to cloud storage
2. Rewind.io for quick restore capability
3. Monthly full account export stored offline
4. Document your monday.com structure so you could rebuild if needed

**File attachments:** These are NOT included in standard exports. Use the API to download them separately. This is the biggest gap.1c:T525,We run a $40M/year GC operation on monday.com. Here's our honest experience:

**What monday.com handles well:**
• Project milestones and high-level timelines (Timeline view)
• Subcontractor management (dedicated board with compliance tracking)
• Change order tracking (form intake → approval workflow)
• Office ↔ field communication (mobile app is good enough)
• Budget tracking (formula columns for committed/actual/variance)

**What needs workarounds:**
• RFIs: We built a custom RFI board with auto-numbering via automations
• Daily logs: Mobile form submission works but isn't as smooth as Procore
• Document management: monday.com's file storage is basic. We use Google Drive + links.
• Punch lists: Works great as a board with mobile photo upload

**vs Procore/BuilderTrend:**
Procore is purpose-built for construction. If you have $30K+/year budget and want every construction-specific feature, go Procore.

monday.com advantage: Flexibility. We customized boards for our exact workflow. Procore forces you into their workflow.

**Cost comparison:**
• monday.com Pro: ~$500/month for 33 users
• Procore: ~$2,500/month (construction software tax)

We chose monday.com because it's 80% of Procore at 20% of the price. The 20% gap is mostly in drawing management and detailed scheduling.1d:T568,Set up monday.com for 15+ real estate teams. Here's the template I recommend:

**Board 1: Deal Pipeline**
• Groups: Lead, Active Showing, Offer Submitted, Under Contract, Closed, Lost
• Columns: Property Address, Client Name, Price, Commission %, Agent, Close Date, Status
• Formula: Commission Amount = Price × Commission %
• Automation: When status changes to 'Under Contract,' create Transaction Checklist items

**Board 2: Transaction Checklists**
• Connected to Deal Pipeline via Connect Boards
• Items: Home Inspection, Appraisal, Title Search, Survey, Final Walk-Through, Closing
• Each item has Due Date, Status, Responsible Party, Notes
• Automation: Deadline reminders 3 days before each milestone

**Board 3: Client CRM**
• All contacts with communication log (Updates section)
• Connected to Deal Pipeline
• Tags: Buyer, Seller, Investor, Referral Source

**Dashboard: Agent Performance**
• Deals per agent, Total volume, Average days to close, Commission earned

**What it replaces:**
• Spreadsheets ✓ (Deal Pipeline)
• Basic CRM ✓ (Client board)
• Transaction management ✓ (Checklists)

**What you still need separately:**
• Calendly (or use monday.com forms for showing requests)
• Mailchimp (monday.com's email capabilities aren't sufficient for drip campaigns)

ROI: My clients save 10-15 hours/week in admin time after setup.1e:T525,Built and refined our onboarding system over 18 months. Here's what works:

**The magic automation:**
When a new hire is added to the 'New Employees' board, automatically:
1. Create 25+ checklist items across 3 boards (IT, HR, Manager)
2. Set due dates relative to start date
3. Assign tasks to relevant people (IT director, hiring manager, HR)
4. Send welcome email to new hire
5. Create Slack notification in #new-hires

All of this happens with ONE action: adding the new hire.

**Board structure:**
• Board 1: New Hire Tracker (master view - one item per hire)
• Board 2: IT Setup Tasks (equipment, accounts, access)
• Board 3: HR Tasks (paperwork, benefits, compliance)
• Board 4: Manager Tasks (training plan, introductions, check-ins)

**30/60/90 tracking:**
Subitems on the New Hire Tracker:
• 30 days: Complete training modules, meet all team members, first project assigned
• 60 days: Independent work begins, first performance check-in
• 90 days: Full productivity, formal review

Each milestone has automations for manager reminders.

**Skip the HR template — build custom.** The template is too generic. Every company's onboarding is different.

**Result:** Onboarding went from 'chaotic' to 'delightful.' New hires consistently say it's the most organized onboarding they've experienced.1f:T5d7,I've set this up for 10+ dev teams. Here's the battle-tested structure:

**Board 1: Product Backlog**
• Groups: Icebox, Backlog, Ready for Sprint, In Sprint
• Columns: Title, Type (Feature/Bug/Tech Debt), Priority (P0-P3), Story Points, Epic, Requester
• Keep this as the single source of truth for all work
• Product manager owns prioritization

**Board 2: Sprint Board (one per active sprint)**
• Groups: To Do, In Progress, Code Review, QA, Done
• Mirror key columns from Backlog
• Add: Assignee, Branch Name, PR Link, Sprint Goal
• Automation: When all sprint items are Done, notify #engineering

**Board 3: Release Tracker**
• Items = releases (v1.2, v1.3, etc.)
• Connected to Sprint Board items
• Status: Planning → Development → QA → Staging → Production
• Release notes column

**GitHub Integration:**
• Install the GitHub app from monday.com marketplace
• Link repos to boards
• PRs automatically appear on items when branch names match
• Commit messages referencing item IDs update the item

**Velocity Dashboard:**
• Chart widget: Story points completed per sprint (line chart)
• Numbers widget: Current sprint burndown
• Battery widget: Sprint completion %

**Sprint ceremony automation:**
• Sprint start: Auto-move 'Ready for Sprint' items to new Sprint Board
• Sprint end: Auto-move incomplete items back to Backlog with 'Carried Over' tag

The key to avoiding chaos: Keep boards focused. Don't try to put everything on one board.20:T4e2,I've led enterprise rollouts of both platforms. Here's my experience:

**Wrike advantages at enterprise scale:**
• More granular permissions and folder structures
• Better resource management (capacity planning across projects)
• Stronger reporting engine (custom report builder)
• More mature API with better documentation
• Proofing/approval workflows for creative teams

**monday.com advantages at enterprise scale:**
• 3x faster adoption rate (UX matters enormously at 200 people)
• More flexible board structures
• Better marketplace/ecosystem
• Superior automation builder
• Dashboards that non-technical users actually understand

**The adoption factor is HUGE.**
I've seen Wrike deployments fail because 40% of users never logged in after training. monday.com's intuitive interface means higher adoption, which means better data, which means better decisions.

**For 200 people:**
monday.com Enterprise gives you SSO, audit logs, advanced permissions, and dedicated support. It's genuinely enterprise-ready now — that wasn't true 2 years ago.

**My recommendation:** Choose monday.com unless you have complex resource management needs that require Wrike's capacity planning features. Adoption trumps features every time.21:T579,Former Excel power user who's used both extensively:

**If your team thinks in spreadsheets: Smartsheet wins on familiarity.**
The interface IS a spreadsheet. Your team will feel at home immediately. Formulas work similarly to Excel. Cell references, cross-sheet formulas, and data manipulation are native.

**If your team needs more than spreadsheets: monday.com wins on versatility.**
monday.com's strength is transforming data into visual workflows. The same data can be viewed as a table, kanban, timeline, chart, or dashboard — instantly.

**Head-to-head comparison:**
• Formulas: Smartsheet ✓ (more Excel-like)
• Conditional formatting: Both good, different approaches
• Data rollups: Smartsheet's sheet summaries vs monday.com's dashboard widgets
• Gantt: Smartsheet ✓ (more traditional, better dependencies)
• Cross-references: Both support it, Smartsheet is more intuitive
• Excel import: Both support it, Smartsheet preserves more formatting
• Automation: monday.com ✓ (far superior)
• Visual appeal: monday.com ✓ (night and day difference)

**For manufacturing ops specifically:**
Smartsheet if you need detailed scheduling and formula-heavy tracking. monday.com if you need team collaboration, automations, and visual reporting.

Many manufacturing teams use both: Smartsheet for detailed operational data, monday.com for project management and team coordination.22:T604,Here are our top 5 time-saving workflows:

**1. The Cascade Automation (saves ~3 hours/week)**
When a project status changes to 'Approved,' automatically:
• Create 12 task items from a template board
• Set due dates relative to project start date
• Assign team members based on project type
• Notify the team in Slack
• Create a client-facing board with mirrored data

**2. The Escalation Chain (saves ~2 hours/week)**
• Item overdue by 1 day → notify assignee
• Overdue by 3 days → notify manager + change priority to High
• Overdue by 7 days → notify director + move to 'Escalated' group
No more manually chasing overdue items.

**3. Smart Intake Routing (saves ~2 hours/week)**
Form submission → automation checks Project Type:
• Website → Board A, assign Team 1
• Marketing → Board B, assign Team 2
• Support → Board C, assign on-call rotation
Zero manual triage.

**4. Auto-Generated Reports (saves ~2 hours/week)**
• Monday morning: Dashboard PDF auto-sent to leadership
• Friday afternoon: Weekly summary posted to Slack
• Month-end: Auto-calculate metrics and update reporting board

**5. The Data Bridge (saves ~1 hour/week)**
Mirror columns connecting Sales → Projects → Finance
• When deal closes, project board auto-populates budget
• When project completes, finance board gets final costs
• Zero double entry across departments

**Scaling tip:** Use workspace templates. When onboarding a new client, duplicate the template workspace and all boards/automations are pre-built.23:T53d,I have 2 apps on the monday.com marketplace. Here's the real experience:

**Developer experience: 7/10**
• Documentation is good but has gaps (especially for complex features)
• The monday-sdk-js is essential and well-maintained
• React is the recommended frontend framework
• Tunneling for local development works well
• Support is responsive but slow for edge cases

**App review process:**
• Submit app → Initial review (1-2 weeks)
• Security review → Functionality review → UX review
• Can take 4-8 weeks total for first submission
• Updates are faster (1-2 weeks)
• They're strict about UX guidelines — plan for revisions

**Revenue model:**
• You set your own pricing
• monday.com takes 20% marketplace commission
• You handle billing through monday.com's system
• Payouts are monthly

**Realistic user expectations:**
• Niche app: 50-200 installs in first year
• Good category app: 500-2000 installs
• Top apps: 10,000+ installs
• Conversion from free to paid: ~5-10%

**Tech stack:**
• React + TypeScript for frontend
• Node.js for backend (or serverless — Lambda/Cloud Functions)
• monday.com SDK for platform integration
• OAuth 2.0 for authentication

**Gotcha:** The app runs inside an iframe in monday.com. Cross-origin limitations apply. Plan your architecture accordingly.24:T5ba,Evaluated monday.com Enterprise for our regulated industry (healthcare). Here's the security breakdown:

**Certifications:**
• SOC 2 Type II ✓
• ISO 27001 ✓
• ISO 27018 ✓
• GDPR compliant ✓
• HIPAA compliant (Enterprise plan with BAA) ✓

**Authentication & Access:**
• SAML 2.0 SSO ✓ (Okta, Azure AD, OneLogin, etc.)
• SCIM provisioning ✓ (auto-add/remove users)
• 2FA enforcement ✓
• Session management (timeout settings) ✓
• IP address restrictions ✓ (Enterprise only)
• Password policies ✓

**Data Security:**
• AES-256 encryption at rest ✓
• TLS 1.2+ in transit ✓
• AWS infrastructure (SOC certified data centers) ✓
• Data residency: US and EU options ✓
• No data shared with third parties for advertising ✓

**Audit & Monitoring:**
• Comprehensive audit logs ✓ (who did what, when)
• Login activity tracking ✓
• API access logging ✓
• Data export audit trails ✓

**Concerns for financial services:**
• No on-premise deployment option (cloud-only)
• File storage limits may require external DMS
• Custom data retention policies need Enterprise plan
• Some integrations (Zapier, Make) send data through third-party servers

**Recommendation:** monday.com Enterprise meets most enterprise security requirements. Request their SOC 2 report directly — they'll share it under NDA. For financial services, ensure you configure IP restrictions and session timeouts appropriately.9:["$","$1","c",{"children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-[860px] mx-auto","children":[["$","section",null,{"className":"pt-14 pb-10 text-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"inline-flex items-center gap-1.5 px-3.5 py-1.5 bg-red-500/10 text-red-500 text-xs font-semibold rounded-full mb-5 uppercase tracking-wider border border-red-500/15","children":"Community Forum"}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"text-4xl md:text-5xl font-extrabold tracking-tighter leading-[1.1] mb-4","children":["Real answers for"," ",["$","span",null,{"className":"bg-gradient-to-br from-red-500 via-orange-400 to-red-500 bg-[length:200%_200%] bg-clip-text text-transparent animate-gradient-shift","children":"monday.com"}]]}],["$","p",null,{"className":"text-slate-500 dark:text-slate-400 text-[17px] leading-relaxed max-w-[520px] mx-auto","children":"The community for monday.com power users.

If your projects are heavily sequential (task B can't start until task A is done), Asana's timeline view is superior.\n\nFor a marketing agency, I'd lean toward monday.com. The client portal feature is a game-changer — you can share specific boards with clients without them seeing your internal processes. The dashboard widgets are also more customizable for client reporting.\n\nPrice-wise, monday.com starts at $8/seat vs Asana's $10.99, but monday.com's Pro plan ($16) unlocks features that Asana charges more for."},{"author":"mike-caldwell","timestamp":"20 hours ago","votes":18,"isAccepted":false,"content":"Former Asana user, current monday.com power user here.
